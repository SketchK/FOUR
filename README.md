## FOUR: Project Introductory Guide

>Please build with the latest CocoaPods v0.39.0 and Xcode 7.3.1 or above

## Intro

FOUR is a beautiful and lightweight task-recorder app, revolving around the theme of "10000 Hour Rule", encourage user to achieve their goal.

The project's architecture is easy to understand, following the common software pattern MVC, separating UI, business logic and data model. Now, let's dive into the FOUR project!

## Model

Realm helps us a lot with data persistence. You can checkout the Model file to learn how I add, modify, update or delete data in Realm database.

## UI(View & ViewController)

I use pure code to setup all UI files, and this solution looks like a hard way, but convenient for code view.

## TODO

>1.Add Animation on Time-Record View  
>2.Add Sounds Effect   
>3.Add Share Function  
>4.Update UI Design  
>5.Fix Some Bug  
>6.Always Code Review

## Future

In the future, I will build up the same app by `Swift` Version, `ReactiveCocoa` Version, `RxSwift` Version, `React Native` Version.  

Why I want to do this? Just For Fun!
